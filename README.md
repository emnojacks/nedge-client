# Nedge Climbing

## NEDGE: an app for the common climber

### Nudging users closer to the edge of their climbing ability by catalyzing healthier mental pathways and physical conditions.

## About 

As climbers, we’ve all experienced the plateau. Most of us reach it
before we are internally satisfied with our performance. While in
the dreaded plateau, we either give up our conscious or unconscious
goals, carry on for years wondering why we never advance, or give up
climbing entirely out of growing resentment.

Nedge is an application for rock climbers of all skill levels and experience that allows users to observe and become aware of their climbing patterns and the habits that may directly affect their performance. We are climbers but first and foremost we are humans therefore respond to proven
behavior change interventions at the core of this app.
